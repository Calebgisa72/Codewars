# MaxProfit

# Imagine you're buying and selling stocks throughout the year. Your job is to find the biggest profit you could make by buying low, and selling high only once

# Hereâ€™s what youâ€™re given: A list of stock prices for each day ðŸ‘‰ [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]

# Hereâ€™s what you need to find: The difference between the cheapest price you could have bought the stock and the most expensive price you could have sold it later on.
